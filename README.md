# MedicalWebScraper
This is a code used to take information from medical websites. All information taken is used to generate responses to medical inquiries.

The problem being addressed with this code is the reliance on physicians for medical advice. I am working on creating a chatbot that can use scaped information to help individuals educate themselves about medicine through certified sources such as government health pages and doctor-certified medical pages such as WebMD. 

The goal is to reduce patient wait times at hospitals and physicians by giving the general public a chance to self-diagnose based on symptoms they may be feeling. This code is to be used in conjunction with a chatbot being made on Microsoft Azure's Machine Learning Pipeline and Bot Services.

This is a demo code of what I plan to advance in the near future. Version 1 features the scraping of Flu symptoms and information from the American Lung Association. They are in no way associated with this project.
